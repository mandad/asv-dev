CHRobotics GP9 Interface
========================
Provides functionality for reading from and writing to a CHRobotics GP9 AHRS (integrated inertial navigation and GPS sytem) using Python.  Tested with Python 2.7 but intended to be compatible with Python 3.3+.  More information about the GP9 can be found [here](http://www.chrobotics.com/shop/gp9-ahrs)

Currently does not decode or write to all packet types, only the ones needed for my projects have been implemented.
