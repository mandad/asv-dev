CHRobotics GP9 MOOS Interface
=============================

This driver provides an interface to a MOOS database for a CHRobotics GP9 integrated GPS/IMU system.  It interfaces over a serial port as specified in the configuration file, and is able to read and write any parameter for the device.

At the moment, only basic position and orientation are reported to the MOOSDB.
